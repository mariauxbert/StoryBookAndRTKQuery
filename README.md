**Project Name: React Native Storybook with RTK Query**

## README

Welcome to the React Native Storybook with RTK Query project! This repository contains code for a React Native application integrated with Storybook for UI component development and Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for efficient data fetching and caching.

### Project Overview

The React Native Storybook with RTK Query project aims to streamline the development process by providing a visual environment for designing and testing UI components using Storybook. Additionally, it leverages RTK Query for managing data fetching and caching in a Redux-powered application, enhancing performance and scalability.
